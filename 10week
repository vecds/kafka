10.	Introduce Kafka Connect and demonstrate how to use connectors to integrate with external systems.

Kafka Connect is a tool to reliably stream data between Kafka topic and external datastores using out of the box libraries, 
without writing even a single line of code. It is usually used to replicate data between standard external datastores, 
for example excel to MySql , via Kafka topic in between.

Following are the steps to stream data from a source file to a target file using Kafka FileStream Connectors.
Prerequisite
Install Kafka as per this guideline. Kafka connect comes along with standard Kafka installation, so no need to install it separately.

Step 1
Start zookeeper server from Kafka installation bin directory using below command.
./zookeeper-server-start.bat ./config/zookeeper.properties

Step 2
Start Kafka server from Kafka installation bin directory using below command.
./kafka-server-start.bat ./config/server.properties

Step 3
Add “connect-file-3.3.2.jar” to plugin.path in “config/connect-standalone.properties” file as per below 
(Replace your installation directory accordingly). 

This jar version could be different if you are working on different Kafka version than here. 
Replace JsonConvertor with String convertor for data transfer for text document.

key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter
plugin.path=C:/kafka/libs/connect-file-3.8.0.jar


Step 4
Create a source file (source.txt) and update “config/connect-file-source.properties” file accordingly. 
Save changes as below.

name=local-file-source
connector.class=FileStreamSource
tasks.max=1
file=C:/kafka/connect/source.txt
topic=connect-test

Step 5
Create a target file(target.txt) and update “config/connect-file-sink.properties” file accordingly. 
Save changes as below.

name=local-file-sink
connector.class=FileStreamSink
tasks.max=1
file=C:/kafka/connect/target.txt
topics=connect-test

Step 6
Start Kafka connector in standalone mode using below command from Kafka installation bin directory.

.\bin\windows\connect-standalone.bat .\config\connect-standalone.properties .\config\connect-file-source.properties .\config\connect-file-sink.properties

Once successfully up, any change made on the source file will immediately reflect on the target file. 
Kafka connect FileStreamSource will stream any change in the source file into kafka topic. 
And FileStreamSink will steam it from kafka topic into the target file.
