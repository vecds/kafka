1. Install Apache Kafka on a single node.

To install Apache Kafka on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK):
•	Download the latest JDK from Oracle's official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
•	Follow the installation instructions provided with the JDK.
•	Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory.
•	Open command prompt and type “java –version” to check java installed.

2. Download Apache Kafka:
•	Visit the Apache Kafka downloads page: https://kafka.apache.org/downloads
•	Download the latest stable Scala Binaries release for Windows.
 
3. Extract the Downloaded File:
•	Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a desired location on your system.

4. Set Environment Variables:
•	Under "System variables", create a new variable named "KAFKA_HOME" and set its value to the directory where you extracted the Kafka files.
•	Edit the "Path" variable and add the following paths:
o	%KAFKA_HOME%\bin
o	%KAFKA_HOME%\bin\windows

Kafka configuration
Copy the path of the Kafka folder. Now go to config inside kafka folder and open zookeeper.properties file. Copy the path against the field dataDir and add /zookeeper-data to the path.
 
For example if the path is c:/kafka
Now in the same folder config open server.properties and scroll down to log.dirs and paste the path. To the path add /kafka-logs
 This completes the configuration of zookeeper and kafka server.

5. Start the Kafka Broker:
Now open command prompt and change the directory to the kafka folder. First start zookeeper using the command given below:
.\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties

Now open another command prompt and change the directory to the kafka folder. Run kafka server using the command:
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat  .\config\server.properties

If the Kafka server starts successfully, you've installed it correctly. Now kafka is running and ready to stream data.
The broker will start listening on the port specified in the server.properties file (usually default broker.id: 0 & port:9092).
These are the basic steps to install and use Apache Kafka on single node.
